        <p class="mt-8 mb-8">We make a platform that split one video into multiple pieces, makes it into NFT tokens, and
            sell it.

        <p class="mb-8">When you upload video content, it makes multiple video fragments
            Each piece of video is made with NFT tokens and can be sold.

            We want to create an NFT model suitable for commercially high-value content such as movies and music videos.
            Such commercial content is an important element in itself, and at the same time, a character or special
            event has a special meaning.

            Video buyers can purchase their favorite scenes or figures of people they like at an affordable price, and
            video sellers can sell videos at a higher price.

            Collectors may have to pay more to own the entire video, but this can be a great motivator for content
            creators.
